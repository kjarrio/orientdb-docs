## Deleting Roles

## Adding Rules to a Role

To add a new security rule for the selected role, click the *Add Rule* button.
This will ask you the string of the resource that you want to secure. For a list of 
available resources, see [Resources](../../security/Database-Security.md#resources)

Then you can configure the CRUD permissions on the newly created resource.
