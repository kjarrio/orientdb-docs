# PyOrient Transactions - `begin()`

This method initiates a transaction.

## Beginning Transactions

When you initialize a transaction through the [`tx_commit()`](PyOrient-Client-Tx-Commit.md) client method, the return object provides you with several methods used in controlling the transaction process.  Using the `begin()` method, you can initiate a transaction on this object.

Beginning a transactions effectively saves the database state.  In the event that there is a problem with operations made after this point, you can revert the database back to this point using the [`rollback()`](PyOrient-Tx-Rollback.md) method.  Alternatively, you can commit the changes to the database using the [`commit()`](PyOrient-Tx-Commit.md) method.

**Syntax**

```
tx.begin()
```

**Example**

For instance, say for a web application you want to create a series of new records on the database through a transaction.  This ensures that, in the event that something goes wrong in the process, you can revert the database to its earlier state rather than committing an incomplete operation.

```py
# Initialize Transaction Control Object
tx = client.tx_commit()

# Begin Transaction
tx.begin()

try:
   # Create Records
   for record in records:
      new = client.record_create(cluster_id, record)
      tx.attach(new)
except:
   tx.rollback()

# Commit Changes
tx.commit()
```

Here, your application has an array of records stored in the `records` object.  It initializes a transaction object with the [`tx_commit()`](PyOrient-Client-Tx-Commit.md) client method, then begins the transaction with `begin()`.  Within a `try` statement, it loops through this array, using the [`record_create()`](PyOrient-Client-Record-Create.md) method to create new records.  After it creates the record, it attaches the operations to the open transaction.

In the event that there is a problem, Python executes the `except` statement, which calls [`rollback()`](PyOrient-Tx-Rollback.md), reverting the database to its earlier state.  If it's able to create all the records in the array, it issues the [`commit()`](PyOrient-Tx-Commit.md) method to commit the changes to the database.
