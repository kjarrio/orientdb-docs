## Migration Strategies

Importing data from Neo4j into OrientDB is a straightforward process.

To migrate, you may use the _Neo4j to OrientDB Importer_. Starting from OrientDB version 2.2, this is the preferred way to migrate from Neo4j.

The _Neo4j to OrientDB Importer_ allows you to migrate Neo4j's nodes, relationships, constraints and indexes. For more details, please refer to the [Neo4j to OrientDB Importer](../neo4j-to-orientdb-importer/README.md) Section.	

**Note:** if your data is in CSV format, you can migrate to OrientDB using the [OrientDB's ETL](../etl/ETL-Introduction.md) tool.
