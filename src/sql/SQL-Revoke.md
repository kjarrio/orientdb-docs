# SQL - `REVOKE`

Changes permissions of a role, revoking access to one or more resources.  To give access to a resource to the role, see the [`GRANT`](SQL-Grant.md) command.

**Syntax**

```
REVOKE [ <permission> | POLICY <policyName> ] ON <resource> FROM <role>
```
- **`<permission>`** Defines the permission you want to revoke from the role.
- **`<policyName>`** Defines the name of a security policy
- **`<resource>`** Defines the resource on which you want to revoke the permissions.
- **`<role>`** Defines the role you want to revoke the permissions.

**Examples**

- Revoke permission to delete records on any cluster to the role `backoffice`:

  <pre>
  orientdb> <code class='lang-sql userinput'>REVOKE DELETE ON database.cluster.* FROM backoffice</code>
  </pre>

- Revoke a security policy previously assigned to `backoffice` profile on Person class:

  <pre>
  orientdb> <code class='lang-sql userinput'>REVOKE POLICY ON database.class.Person FROM backoffice</code>
  </pre>
