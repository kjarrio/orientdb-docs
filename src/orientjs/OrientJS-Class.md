# OrientJS Class API

Once you have initialized a database instance, you can use it to access and manipulate classes in OrientDB, through the OrientJS Class API.  This allows you to work with the database schema, in the event that you want to use a schema.

Methods for the Class API are accessible through the `db.class` object.

- [**Working with Classes**](OrientJS-Class-Classes.md) Using these methods you can operate on the class itself: listing those available, creating, extending and updating classes, as well as fetching the object itself.
- [**Working with Properties**](OrientJS-Class-Properties.md) Using these methods, you can operate on class properties: listing those available, creating, removing and updating the properties.
- [**Working with Records**](OrientJS-Class-Records.md) Using these methods, you can operate on records through the Class API: listing and creating records on the class, as an alternative to the OrientJS [Query Builder](OrientJS-Query.md).
