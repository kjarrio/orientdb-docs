# OResultSet - elementStreram()

Retrieves a stream of elements from the result-set.

## Streaming Edges

In cases where your result-set contains a number of elements, some of which are vertices and some of which are edges, you can use this method to filter [`OResultSet`](../OResultSet.md) to only return those records that are [`OElement`](../OElement.md) instances.

### Syntax

```
default Stream<OElement> OResultSet().elementStream()
```

#### Return Value

This method returns a [`Stream`]({{ book.javase }}/java/util/Stream.html) of [`OElement`](../OElement.md) instances contained in the result-set.
