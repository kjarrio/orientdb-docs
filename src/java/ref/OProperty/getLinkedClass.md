# OProperty - getLinkedClass()

Retrieves the class linked to the property.

## Retrieving Linked Classes

Properties are generally created as fields in a database class, (that is, an [`OClass`](../OClass.md) instance).  Using this method, you can retrieve the database class to which the given [`OProperty`](../OProperty.md) instance is linked.

OrientDB retrieves this class in lazy mode, because while unmarshalling, the class could not be loaded.

### Syntax

```
OClass OProperty.getLinkedClass()
```

#### Return Value

This method returns the [`OClass`](../OClass.md) instance linked to the property.
