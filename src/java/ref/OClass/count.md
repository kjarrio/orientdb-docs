# OClass - count()

This method counts the number of the records of this class.  It also considers the records in subclasses.

## Counting Records

When you create records on the database, they're created as part of a database class.  Using this method you can retrieve a count of all records created on the given class.  By default, it includes all subclasses.  You can also pass it a [`Boolean`]({{ book.javase }}/api/java/lang/Boolean.html) instance to define whether you want it to exclude subclass records.

### Syntax

```
// METHOD 1
Long OClass().count() 

// METHOD 2
Long OClass().count(Boolean isPolymorphic)
```

| Argument | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **`isPolymorphic`** | [`Boolean`]({{ book.javase }}/api/java/lang/Boolean.html) | Determines whether method includes records of subclasses in the count |

#### Return Value

This method returns a [`Long`]({{ book.javase }}/api/java/lang/Long.html) instance, which provides the number of records in the database class or class and subclasses.

### Example

Imagine a social media application where the user accounts are defined by a dedicated class.  You might use the `count()` method to report membership on the webpage.

```java	
private ODatabaseDocument;
private Logger logger;

public Long getUserCount(){

   // Retrieve the User OClass
   OClass userCls = db.getClass("users");

   // Return User Count
   return userCls.count();
}
```

This method uses the [`getClass()`](../ODatabaseDocument/getClass.md) method to retrieve the user class name, the executes the `count()` method to return the number of records on the class.
