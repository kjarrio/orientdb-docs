# OEdge - getFrom()

This method retrieves the vertex that connects from this edge.


## Retrieving Vertices

Edges provide links between vertices.  The link connects from one vertex and to another.  This method allows you to retrieve the [`OVertex`](../OVertex.md) instance that links from the edge.  To access the vertex that links to the edge, see the [`getTo()`](getTo.md) method.

### Syntax

```
OVertex OEdge().getFrom()
```

#### Return Value

This method returns the [`OVertex`](../OVertex.md) instance that links from this edge.
