Using this method, you can retrieve the language that the function uses when it executes its code.  To set the language for the function, see the [`setLanguage()`](setLanguage.md) method.


### Syntax

```
String OFunction().getLanguage()
```

#### Return Type

This method returns a `String` instance, which contains the language that the function uses when it executes code.
