# Java API - OType

This class provides a standard interface for handling data-types within the database.

## Managing Types

Properties on a database class have types and can enforce type-based constraints on the data the class allows for its records.  OrientDB uses the `OType` class to define the data-types for the property and to provide methods for common operations performed on data-types for the property.

This class is availabe at `com.orientechnologies.orient.core.metadata.schema`:

```java
import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.metadata.schema.OType;
```

For more information on types, see [Types](../../general/Types.md).
