# OSecurityRole

Provides an interface for working with and operating on roles.

## Using Roles

In OrientDB, roles allow you to assign privileges to a user in bulk rather than individually.  For instance, an account that needs to manage a blog would need read and write permissions on certain classes.  Roles allow you to give a new account the privileges it needs to function in one command, rather than through a series of individual grants.

To operate on roles in your application, import the class:

```java
import com.orientechnologies.orient.core.metadata.security.OSecurityRole;
```
