# MarcoPolo - `script()`

This method executes a script on the database.

>**NOTE**: In order for this to work, you must first enable scripting on OrientDB.  For more information, see [JavaScript](../js/Javascript-Command.md).

## Scripting the Database

OrientDB provides support for scripting operations in JavaScript and other languages. This allows you to develop a repository of common operations or to share functions between applications developed in different languages. 

### Syntax

```
script(<conn>, <language>, <script>, <opts>)
```

- **`<conn>`** Defines the database connection.
- **`<language>`** Defines the language of the script.
- **`<script>`** Defines the script to execute.
- **`<opts>`** Defines additional options for the function.

#### Options

This function only provides on additional option:

- **`:timeout`** Defines the timeout value in milliseconds.  In the event that the script takes longer than the allotted time to finish, MarcoPolo sends an exit signal to the calling process.

#### Return Values

When the script is successful, it returns the tuple `{:ok, record}`, where the variable is the last record the script operates on.  In the event that the operation fails, it returns the tuple `{:error, message}` where the variable is the exception message.

### Example

For instance, imagine you have a series of stored scripts to handle common operations on OrientDB.  In porting your current application to Elixir, you may want to save these scripts and continue to use them.

```elixir
@doc """ Run the given script on OrientDB"""
def run_script(conn, path) do

	# Log Operation
	IO.puts("Running Script #{path}")
	{:ok, script} = IO.read(path)

	# Run Script
	{:ok, return} = MarcoPolo.script(conn, "JavaScript", script)

end
```
