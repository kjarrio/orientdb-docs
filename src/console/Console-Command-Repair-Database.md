# Console - `REPAIR DATABASE`

Repairs a database. To check if a database needs to be repaired, you can use the [Check Database Command](Console-Command-Check-Database.md).

**Syntax**

```sql
REPAIR DATABASE [--fix-graph [-skipVertices=<vertices>] [-skipEdges=<edges>]]
                [--fix-links] [-v]]
                [--fix-ridbags]
                [--fix-bonsai]
                [-v]
```

- **`[--fix-graph]`** Fixes the database as graph. All broken edges are removed and all corrupted vertices repaired. This mode takes the following optional parameters:
 - **`-skipVertices=<vertices>`**, where `<vertices>` are the number of vertices to skip on repair.
 - **`-skipEdges=<edges>`**, where `<edges>` are the number of edges to skip on repair.
- **`[--fix-links]`** Fixes links. It removes any reference to not existent records. The optional `[-v]` tells to print more information.
- **`[--fix-ridbags]`** Fixes the ridbag structures only (collection of references). 
- **`[--fix-bonsai]`** Fixes the bonsai structures only (internal representation of trees)
- **`[-v]`** Verbose mode

**Examples**
