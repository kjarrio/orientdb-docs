# _Dashboard_ Panel

> Only users with grant `server.metrics` can see this section 

Studio Enterprise Edition includes an easy-to-read and single-page _Dashboard_ with constantly updated reports.
The _Dashboard_ shows a graphical presentation of the current status and historical trends of each node joining your cluster. Performance indicators are reported in order to enable instantaneous and informed decisions which you can make at a glance.

Here you can see the Dashboard reporting the status of a cluster composed of 1 node.

For each node you can monitor several information divided in two main sections:
- System report
  - `CPU`, `RAM`, `DISK CACHE` and `DISK` used
  - `Status` of the node
  - `Operations`
  - `Active Sessions`
  - `Network Requests`

- CRUD operations: includes a `Live Chart` of CRUD operations in real time.
