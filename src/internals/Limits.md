# Limits

Below are the limitations of the OrientDB engine:
- **Databases**: There is no limit to the number of databases per server or embedded. Users reported no problem with 1000 databases open
- **Clusters**: each database can have a maximum of 32,767 clusters (2^15-1)
- **Records** per cluster (**Documents**, **Vertices** and **Edges** are stored as records): can be up to 9,223,372,036,854,780,000 (2^63-1), namely 9,223,372 Trillion records
- **Records** per database (**Documents**, **Vertices** and **Edges** are stored as records): can be up to 302,231,454,903,000,000,000,000 (2^78-1), namely 302,231,454,903 Trillion records
- **Record size**: up to 2GB each, even if we suggest avoiding the creation of records larger than 10MB. They can be split into smaller records, take a look at [Binary Data](../java/Binary-Data.md)
- **Document Properties** can be:
 - up to 2 Billion per database for schema-full properties
 - there is no limitation regarding the number of properties in schema-less mode. The only concrete limit is the size of the Document where they can be stored. Users have reported no problems working with documents made of 15,000 properties
- **Indexes** can be up to 2 Billion per database. There are no limitations regarding the number of indexes per class
- **Queries** can return a maximum of 2 Billion rows, no matter the number of the properties per record
- **Concurrency level**: in order to guarantee atomicity and consistency, OrientDB acquire an exclusive lock on the storage during transaction commit. This means transactions are serialized. Giving this limitation, _the OrientDB team is already working on improving parallelism to achieve better scalability on multi-core machines by optimizing internal structure to avoid exclusive locking._

Look also at the [limitations with distributed setup](../distributed/Distributed-Architecture.md#limitations).
