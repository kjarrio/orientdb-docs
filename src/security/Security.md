# Security

OrientDB is the NoSQL implementation with the greatest focus on security.

- To connect to an existing database, you need a user and password.  Users and roles are defined inside the database.  For more information on this process, see [Database Security](Database-Security.md).

- In the event that you're connecting to the OrientDB Server that is hosting the database, you can access the database using the server's user.  For more information on this process, see [Server Security](Server-Security.md).

- Additionally, you can encrypt the database contents on disk.  For more information on this process, see [Database Encryption](Database-Encryption.md).
