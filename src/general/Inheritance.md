# Inheritance

Unlike many Object-relational mapping tools, OrientDB does not split documents between different classes.  Each document resides in one or a number of clusters associated with its specific class.  When you execute a query against a class that has subclasses, OrientDB searches the clusters of the target class and all subclasses.

## Declaring Inheritance in Schema

In developing your application, bear in mind that OrientDB needs to know the class inheritance relationship.  This is an abstract concept that applies to both  [POJO's](../java/Object-DB-Interface.md#inheritance) and  [Documents](../java/Document-Database.md).

For example,

```java
OClass account = database.getMetadata().getSchema().createClass("Account");
OClass company = database.getMetadata().getSchema().createClass("Company").setSuperClass(account);
```

## Using Polymorphic Queries

By default, OrientDB treats all queries as polymorphic. Using the example above, you can run the following query from the console:

<pre>
orientdb> <code class="lang-sql userinput">SELECT FROM Account WHERE name.toUpperCase() = 'GOOGLE'</code>
</pre>

This query returns all instances of the classes `Account` and `Company` that have a property name that matches `Google`.

## How Inheritance Works

Consider an example, where you have three classes, listed here with the cluster identifier in the parentheses.

```
Account(10) <|--- Company (13) <|--- OrientTechnologiesGroup (27)
```

By default, OrientDB creates a separate cluster for each class.  It indicates this cluster by the `defaultClusterId` property in the class `OClass` and indicates the cluster used by default when not specified.  However, the class `OClass` has a property `clusterIds`, (as `int[]`), that contains all the clusters able to contain the records of that class.  `clusterIds` and `defaultClusterId` are the same by default.

When you execute a query against a class, OrientDB limits the result-sets to only the records of the clusters contained in the `clusterIds` property.  For example,


<pre>
orientdb> <code class="lang-sql userinput">SELECT FROM Account WHERE name.toUpperCase() = 'GOOGLE'</code>
</pre>

This query returns all the records with the name property set to `GOOGLE` from all three classes, given that the base class `Account` was specified.  For the class `Account`, OrientDB searches inside the clusters `10`, `13` and `27`, following the inheritance specified in the schema.
