# Queries

This Section includes several query examples that you can execute from the [Studio](../../../studio/README.md)'s _Browse Tab_, or from its _Graph Editor_. You may also execute these queries directly from the [Console](../../../console/README.md), or your application through an [API or Driver](../../../apis-and-drivers/README.md).  

{% include "../include-demodb-version-warning.md" %}

The following table can help you navigate through all examples:
