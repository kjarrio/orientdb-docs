## Example 2

Find all the Customer Friends that are not Customers (so that a product can be proposed).

In the _Graph Editor_ included in [Studio](../../../studio/README.md), using the query below, this is the obtained graph:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM (
  SELECT expand(customerFriend) 
  FROM ( 
    MATCH 
      {Class:Customers, as: customer}-HasProfile-{Class:Profiles, as: profile}-HasFriend-{Class:Profiles, as: customerFriend} 
    RETURN customerFriend
  )
) 
WHERE in('HasProfile').size()=0
```

In the _Browse Tab_ of [Studio](../../../studio/README.md), using the query below, this is the obtained list of records (only few records are shown in the image below):

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT @Rid as Friend_RID, Name as Friend_Name, Surname as Friend_Surname 
FROM (
  SELECT expand(customerFriend) 
  FROM (
    MATCH 
      {Class:Customers, as: customer}-HasProfile-{Class:Profiles, as: profile}-HasFriend-{Class:Profiles, as: customerFriend} 
    RETURN customerFriend
  )
) 
WHERE in('HasProfile').size()=0
ORDER BY Friend_RID
```
